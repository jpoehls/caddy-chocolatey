    <summary>Caddy is a fast, cross-platform HTTP/2 web server with automatic HTTPS.</summary>
    <description>Caddy is a lightweight, general-purpose web server for Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD and Android. It is a capable alternative to other popular and easy to use web servers. ([@caddyserver](https://twitter.com/caddyserver) on Twitter)

The most notable features are HTTP/2, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) support, Virtual Hosts, TLS + SNI, and easy configuration with a [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile). In development, you usually put one Caddyfile with each site. In production, Caddy serves HTTPS by default and manages all cryptographic assets for you.
