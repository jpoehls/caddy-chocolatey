    <description>Caddy is a lightweight, general-purpose web server for Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD and Android. It is a capable alternative to other popular and easy to use web servers. ([@caddyserver](https://twitter.com/caddyserver) on Twitter)

The most notable features are HTTP/2, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) support, Virtual Hosts, TLS + SNI, and easy configuration with a [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile). In development, you usually put one Caddyfile with each site. In production, Caddy serves HTTPS by default and manages all cryptographic assets for you.

    <releaseNotes>With 0.8.2, Caddy gets On-Demand TLS, which means it can obtain certificates during TLS handshakes; it does not need to know all the names when you start the server. Caddy is now built on Go 1.6, meaning faster crypto and highly-optimized garbage collection. Caddy no longer restarts on its own; only if signaled with USR1 (all certificate maintenance is done in-process now). We've also added support for SHA384 cipher suites and the ability to load certificates in bulk from a folder.

On-Demand TLS is currently under tight rate limits to mitigate abuse. When you enable it, you have to set a hard limit of how many certificates it is allowed to issue using the `max_certs` property of the `tls` directive.

- At most one certificate challenge happens at a time.
- After 10 certificates are successfully obtained, new certificate challenges will not happen until 10 minutes after the last successful challenge.
- A name that fails a challenge will not be allowed to be attempted again for 5 minutes.

This feature -- as well as all automatic HTTPS, even at startup -- is not guaranteed to be supported in the future if ACME CAs are not able to issue certificates in a reasonable timeframe (quicker than 10 minutes). Please speak with your CA if this is of interest to you.

See the [relevant](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#on-demand) [documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/tls) and [release announcement](https://caddyserver.com/blog/caddy-0_8_2-released) for more details.

All notable changes:

- On-demand TLS can obtain certificates during handshakes
- Built with Go 1.6
- Process log (-log) is rotated when it gets large
- Managed certificates get renewed 30 days early instead of just 14
- fastcgi: Allow scheme prefix before address
- markdown: Support for definition lists
- proxy: Allow proxy to insecure HTTPS backends
- proxy: Support proxy to unix socket
- rewrite: Status code can be 2xx or 4xx
- templates: New .Markdown action to interpret included file as Markdown
- templates: .Truncate now truncates from end of string when length is negative
- tls: Set hard limit for certificates obtained with on-demand TLS
- tls: Load certificates from directory
- tls: Add SHA384 cipher suites
- Multiple bug fixes and internal changes</releaseNotes>
